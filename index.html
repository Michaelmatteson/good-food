    <p>Let's use avoccado as an example. Avocado is high in protein for a fruit, and it is good for your heart. Avocados are a source of vitamins C, E, K, and B6, as well as riboflavin, niacin, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and potassium. Avocados contain high levels of healthy, beneficial fats, which can help a person feel more full between meals.</p>

    <p>Salmon -- that tender, reddish, firm fish -- is one of the most popular fish choices in America thanks in part to its rich, buttery flavor. The vitamin B12 in salmon keeps blood and nerve cells humming and helps you make DNA. But for your health, the true beauty of salmon is its wealth of omega-3 fatty acids. Most omega-3s are "essential" fatty acids. Your body can't make them, but they play critical roles in your body. They can lower the chance that you'll have: Cardiovascular disease (including heart attack and stroke). Some types of cancer. Dementia. Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases. They can also ease the effects of rheumatoid arthritis. And that's a good thing for your health.</p>
